        <h3>An Amateur Suverying Tool</h3>
        <p>This app is inspired by the hills of San Francisco.
          It started out because of San Francisco's parking laws require you to curb your tires if a street has more than a 3% grade. 
          It turns out that knowing how steep and tall a hill is can make it more fun to climb to the top.
          Take a walk and do some amateur survey work along the way.

        <h1>What Does this Do?</h1>
        <p>
          At the most basic level this app uses your phone's sensors to measure how steep a hill is.<br>
          You can either use your phone as a level or you can use the camera to target a specific point (like the top of a hill).<br>
          Additionally, it displays your lat-long location and elevation. You can save several points along your walk to map out a larger region. 
          You can also export this as a csv if you want to do a more sophisticated analysis.
