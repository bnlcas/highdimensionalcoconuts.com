                    According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_Missions_amongst_the_Huron">Jesuit missionary accounts</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people">Wyandot (Huron)</a> people of Ontario and Michigan placed great importance on dreams. They believed that good health requires the realization of dreams. They would spend large portions of the winter creating elaborate <a href="https://www.academia.edu/61595915/Contesting_world_views_Dreams_among_the_Huron_and_Jesuits">ritual enactments</a> of the dreams of their friends, families and neighbors.

                    Convincing your friends to make a short skit is probably a tough sell. But seeing your dreams in daylight can be a profound experience. Sadly there are very few outlets for this psychic need. Since January I have been using Stable Diffusion to help render my dreams. I have found that this can be a profoundly helpful ritual. There is something magical about seeing the vision in your mind drawn out in the world. The inherent randomness and clumsiness of generative media acts as an interpreter. Even seeing an incorrect image cues you into the core aspects of the dream. The symbolic significance of key elements becomes clear through prompt iterations.

                    I strongly recommend trying this exercise for yourself. Running stable diffusion is pretty easy. You can make an image for free in your browser with <a href="https://huggingface.co/kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-1?text=a+man+wearing+a+Persian+carpet+over+his+face">Kandinsky on Hugging Face</a>.  
                    it on the browser, you can do it on your phone. I even support <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/diffusioncamera/id6449003538">an iOS app</a> that lets you make a quick render on your phone. It doesnâ€™t take much effort to try it out the next time you recall a fragment of a dream. I think you will be pleased with the outcome.
